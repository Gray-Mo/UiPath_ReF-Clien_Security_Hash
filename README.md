This is the academy's project: Using ReFramework

Opening the ACME website, loging in, navigating to the workItems, filtering them based on item Type.

Once Filtered, we get each item id, hash it using SHA-1 method on an external website(Online Tools).

Once hashed, we copy the hash value from SHA-1 and go back to ACME to update each item's comment section with the hash value.
